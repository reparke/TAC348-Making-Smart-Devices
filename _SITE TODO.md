- [x] add code highlighting
- [x] fix links on resources page
- [x] fix links on credits for week 2 slides
- [x] add static blackboard link to navigation
- [ ] include PDF files on lecture pages (so students can view notes as well as PDF). This would mean using marpit to create PDF files, not HTML since github pages doesn't create viewable MD files if there is an HTML file with the same name already
- [x] resize argon, boron, xenon graphics (make same size as feather)
- [ ] create a variable in config.yml with the start of the semester date; then it could show the date in addition to the week # throughout the site; would need to account for spring break
- [ ] centralize assignment due dates in config.yml instead of assignment pages; this might be more hassle than its worth
- [ ] separate content (most .md files) from files that config site
