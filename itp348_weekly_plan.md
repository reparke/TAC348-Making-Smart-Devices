## 		Things to implement

**Definite**

* [ ] week 8
  * [ ] Create bluetooth fan example could covered during bluetooth lecture
  * [ ] Maybe A9 blynk should change because it is hard and Rob thinks it is "fun"
* [ ] week 10
  * [ ] future semester: consider permanently putting motors here; add something else for week 9

Week 10 idea: 

* [ ] Tues is ultra sonic sensor + project overview; show BRIEFLY how to load images
* [ ] Thurs is using JSON to send multiple values to Initial State; consider recording a video for json overview and moving early
* [ ] week 10 / 11: may need to record JSON videos for clarity
* [ ] week 10 / 11: may need to include a subscribe video or lectu

* [ ] consider moving A9 earlier to be closer to material (even if prelim proposal and A9 overlap)
* [ ] consider removing week 10 OLED graphics, replace with...? JSON, softpot, piezo motion sensor

---

**Maybe**

* [ ] TA recommendations

  * [ ] have small assignment where they layout PCB for a built project; then later in the semester the soldering workshop uses that design (talk to kristof about this so we don't step on 388)
  * [ ] submissions: 
    * [ ] make single zip for upload with code and fritzing
    * [ ] create google doc with photos embedded and video link; 
    * [ ] students should narrate
    * [ ] Rob announce and demostrates in first week
    * [ ] TAs ask for corrected videos if misssing
    * [ ] partial credit for some working
* [ ] Soldering workshop
  * [ ] Plan event in week3 for sometime before week 9
  * [ ] Consider holding during a class session to have more people attend
  * [ ] provide solder (or ask Allan in available)
  * [ ] consider more complicated soldering kit (or variations)
  * [ ] have people check soldering kits before hand for broken LEDs
  * [ ] Maybe we could show them a brief over view or short video of how to make a PCB board and order some from a supplier overseas through Fritzing and then have them solder their board? Or like maybe week 3/4 of school after they have familiarized themselves with fritzing, have students create a simple PCB that would wire some leds and maybe a potentiometer so students can turn the knob and have the soldered leds on the board turn dim/bright. Then the TAs could double check their Fritzing submission and make sure all power/GND wires are connected on the appropriate sides of the PCB then run some tests to make sure the connections are correct. Then wait for the custom boards to arrive and have students in class solder their custom boards. Theres a way to add names and labels to the PCB itself thats really cool
* [ ] create ["cheat sheet"](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) or video about basic workbench operations (flash, create project, import library)
* [ ] 5v voltage regulator: [5V Step-Up Voltage Regulator U3V40F5](https://www.pololu.com/product/4012)
  * [ ] also [SparkFun Buck-Boost Converter]( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15208)
* [ ] tell students not to unclaim device
* [ ] recruit guest lecturers (x2)

**Possible**

* [ ] use something other than blackboard for submissions

* [ ] summary of info. 

  - Maybe a page of "tips" - cool work-around or example of something not completely covered in class. 
- Maybe a page of "oops" - mistakes to be avoided
  - Maybe a page of troubleshooting - there were a few tricky situations people posted on Piazza, a record of that would be cool
  - Maybe a page of ideas - problems to solve. Maybe something you and the TAs add, challenges of all levels for fun
  
  
  
  

**Videos and Wiring Diagrams Needed to Publish**

- [ ] Week 1
- - [ ] record software tools for reference
- [ ] Week 2
- - [ ] PWM (skip and leave for class)
- [ ] Week 3
- - [ ] a5: create new assignment that doesn't use while loop timing, consider using millis
- [ ] Week 4
- - [ ] Multi-tasking (maybe keep a)
  - [ ] Publish (skip)
  - [ ] re-record OLED with I2C slides
- [ ] Week 5
- - [ ] Webhooks / APIs (Initial State can be live)
  - [ ] wk 5: use millis in next assignment (summer)
  - [ ] wk 5: move enum and switch videos to week 6 (summer)
- [ ] Week 8
  - [ ] Motors
- [ ] Week 10
  - [ ] JSON / APIs (need to re-record)
  - [ ] wk11: inquire about future class TAs and kit TA
- [ ] Week 11
  - [ ] Revise JSON in week 10. Try using ArduinoJSON instead of RK. The generation of RK is very tough. This would mean re-recording the parsing video to use ArduinoJSON

## General Feedback (Spring 2021)

- [ ] Assignment 0 and 1 are given out week 1, day 1; due week 2, day 1; that is the pattern
