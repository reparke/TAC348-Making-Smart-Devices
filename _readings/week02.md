## Week {{page.week}}

### Watch before class this week

* Analog vs. Digital 
  {% include video id="rEDHXbWXGl8" provider="youtube" %}
* Watch Analog Input with Potentiometers
  {% include video id="lopRGUS7UEk" provider="youtube" %}

### Bring to class all this week

- Photon 2, breadboard, resistors, push buttons, LEDs, RGB LEDS, wires potentiometer
- *You can see what parts look like visually by checking out the [kit page](https://reparke.github.io/ITP348-Physical-Computing/kit)*

### Build before class Mon / Tues 

- #### none

### Build before class Wed / Thurs 

- none

### Optional C++ Reference

* Quick note: in some of the C++ videos below, they reference `cout` and `cin`. Those are C++ functions that we don't use in programming microcontrollers so you don't need to worry about them. For clarity, all you need to know is that 
  * `cout` is a C++ function to print to the console window like `Serial.println` for the Photon 2 or `print` in Python
  * `cin` is a C++ function to get user input from the keyboard like `input` in Python. The Photon 2 doesn't have an equivalent way to get user input from the keyboard.
* Watch **Arrays in C++**

  {% include video id="2ahS1PG-Ip4" provider="youtube" %}

  {% include video id="BK_vfv_Z188" provider="youtube" %}
* Read [Analog vs. Digital](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/all)
* Watch **Pulse Width Modulation** (we will cover this in class)
