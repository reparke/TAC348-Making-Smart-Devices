/*

    When the magnetic switch is opened or closed, publish cloud event with the
   message door was opened or door was closed. Note only one publish should
   occur every time door is opened or closed (Hint: Think about how this
   operation is similar to other things weâ€™ve done. what variables would you
   need to this?)

    Your event name should be ITP348_Door
    Change the RGB colors based on their door status
        Red means the door is open
        White means the door is closed
