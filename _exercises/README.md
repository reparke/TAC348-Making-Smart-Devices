# TAC 348 Exercises

Below are a combination of my own sample exercises / notes as well as projects created during in-class exercises. 

## Navigating projects

Projects are grouped by week. Any projects created during class are denoted by the suffic **ic** ("in class"). Other projects are related samples, unused exercises, or references for me during class. 

#### Viewing / Downloading firmware
You can find the source code (*.ino) for each project by going to 

```week_#/<<project_name>>/src/```

#### Libraries

If the project contains libraries, it is recommended to download the entire project, not just the source. There will be important items in `project.properties` file  and the ```/lib``` folder

#### Disclaimer

Some of these projects may be incomplete or in-process so they may not work.
