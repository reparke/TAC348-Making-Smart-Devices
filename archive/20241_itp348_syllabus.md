## Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of physical
computing systems through hands-on, real-life applications. Physical computing
forms the basis of **smart devices**, **wearables** like smart watches,
**e-textiles / fashion**, **IoT (Internet of Things) devices**, and hardware
start-up

This course is designed specifically for a **general audience** and **all
majors**. You will learn to design electronic devices that interact with the
physical world. Assignments will use **motion detectors**, **robotic arms**, and
**electronic music generation**.

This course teaches students to design electronic devices that interact with the
physical world by building circuits and developing software algorithms that run
on a microcontroller. Students are expected to be familiar with introductory
programming, but **no prior experience with electronics or microcontrollers is
necessary.**

## Learning Objectives

-   Design a device using a microcontroller and electronic components. 
* Produce an embedded device that measures environmental conditions and sends readings to a cloud storage platform. 
* Produce an embedded device that produces effects in the physical world to accomplish a task.
* Build an interface app to enable communication between a user and a device.
* Control a device from an interface app.
* Describe accessibility challenges for an embedded device and suggest modifications.

## Learning Outcomes

-   Design a simple device that reads sensor data and communicates with an
    internet-based storage platform

-   Determine the appropriate electronic component for specific operations

-   Use a microcontroller to communicate with sensors and motors

**Prerequisite(s):** ITP 115 or ITP 165 or ITP 109 (equivalent courses or

## Course Deliverables

### Hardware Assignments

There will be hardware assignments that are due 1 week after being assigned.
These assignments require building a hardware device with the microcontroller.
Students will typically submit code, a schematic drawing, a photograph of the
finished device, and a video of the device functioning. Code from external
sources may be used as a reference, as long as it is properly cited. These are
to be completed individually unless otherwise noted.

### Programming Assignments

There will be programming assignments which will focus on a further
understanding of problem-solving, algorithms, and logical thinking using C, and
are due 1 week after being assigned. Assignments are to be completed
individually and submitted on Brightspace.



### Final Project Details

#### Schedule

- Week 11 – Project assigned
- Week 12 – Submit project proposal
- Week 13 – Receive feedback on proposal; submit device schematic
- Weeks 12 – 16 – Work on project (in-class milestone week 13)
- Final exam period – Final presentation (Graded)

#### Basic Requirements

The final project is to create a physical device and interface. The concept
of the device is up to the student, but the project proposal must be
approved by the instructor. The proposal should include device
functionality, part list, cost, and a general description of the app.

The final project will be graded on how it fulfills the requirements and the
quality / completion of the device. A project must represent the student’s
sole effort; online tutorials or class examples may be consulted, but they
must be improved upon and noted in the final documentation. Failure to note
and provided links to any reference material will be considered cheating.

#### Project Grading Breakdown

| Item                        | Points |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| Proposal                    | 10     |
| Device schematic            | 20     |
| Device firmware (C++)       | 25     |
| Web or mobile interface app | 20     |
| Functional device           | 25     |
|                             |        |
| Total                       | 100    |

#### Project Demonstration

Students will sign up for a 10 min window during the final exam time during
which their will demonstrate the functionality of their project. No
PowerPoint presentation is needed; rather, students will show the how their
device fulfills the key project requirements. Additional time slots will be
added depending on size of the class.

### Grading Timeline

Assignments will receive feedback after about one week.

### Policies and Expectations

Students are expected to:

-   Attend and participate in lecture discussions

-   Attend and complete weekly assignments

### Grading Issues

Students will have one week after graded feedback is given to contest scores
(e.g. assignments, midterm, and project). After two week, scores will not be
changed.

### Late Policy

-   Assignments are due on the stated day on Brightspace (typically at 11:59 pm)
-   Students are given 5 “grace days” (self-granted extensions) which may be
    used for extra time without penalty
-   Grace days may be used for assignments only, **not the final project**
-   Grace days may be used for one assignment, distributed them across several
    assignments, or even better, saved them for a crisis that thankfully never
    comes
-   Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are
    used and only given in rare, exceptional situations

Important: it is the responsibility of the student to state in their Brightspace
submission that they intend to use a grace day.

## Academic Integrity

The University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form). 

 

This course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the [USC Student Handbook](https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/). All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.



Students must complete their own work without assistance from other students or any outside sources. Other violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.

 

The impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university.

 

For more information about academic integrity see the [student handbook](https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/) or the [Office of Academic Integrity’s website](https://academicintegrity.usc.edu/), and university policies on [Research and Scholarship Misconduct](https://policy.usc.edu/research-and-scholarship-misconduct/)



### Use of AI Generators

- AI generators such as ChatGPT are powerfully useful tools that have great application in software and engineering
- However, the purpose of this class is to specifically to develop creative and critical thinking skills as well as practical knowledge of building devices
- Therefore, using AI-generated tools is prohibited in this course, will be identified as plagiarism, and will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity



## Course Content Distribution and Synchronous Session Recordings Policies 

USC has policies that prohibit recording and distribution of any synchronous and asynchronous course content outside of the learning environment.

 

Recording a university class without the express permission of the instructor and announcement to the class, or unless conducted pursuant to an Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) accommodation. Recording can inhibit free discussion in the future, and thus infringe on the academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor. ([Living our Unifying Values: The USC Student Handbook](https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/), page 13).

 

Distribution or use of notes, recordings, exams, or other intellectual property, based on university classes or lectures without the express permission of the instructor for purposes other than individual or group study. This includes but is not limited to providing materials for distribution by services publishing course materials. This restriction on unauthorized use also applies to all information, which had been distributed to students or in any way had been displayed for use in relationship to the class, whether obtained in class, via email, on the internet, or via any other media. ([Living our Unifying Values: The USC Student Handbook](https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/), page 13).



## Students and Disability Accommodations: 

USC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. [The Office of Student Accessibility Services](https://osas.usc.edu/) (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at [osas.usc.edu](http://osas.usc.edu/). You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at [osasfrontdesk@usc.edu](mailto:osasfrontdesk@usc.edu).
