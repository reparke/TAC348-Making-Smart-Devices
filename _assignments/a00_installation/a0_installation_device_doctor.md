IMPORTANT: This is not the preferred to setup your Photon 2, but if you need to join a Wifi network without a password (like USC Guest Wireless), you should use this approach since https://setup.particle.io doesn't work with empty passwords (as of 1/2024)

Assignment 0 – Installation and Setup
=====================================

*Nothing to submit*

**Requirements**

-   Connect photon 2 to Computer
-   Create Particle account
-   Install Particle Workbench
-   Install Fritzing
-   Add photon 2 device to your Particle account



**IMPORTANT - Browser**

**You need to use the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser to configure your Photon 2; you <u>can not</u> use Firefox or Safari.** 

\_______________________________________\_

## Connect your Particle Photon 2 to your Computer

- Connect the antenna (discussed in class)
- Connect the Photon 2 to your breadboard (discussed in class)
- Connect the micro USB cable to your computer



Create Particle account
-----------------------

>   In this course, we will use an internet-enabled microcontroller,
>   specifically the Particle Photon 2. In order to communicate with the Photon 2
>   (e.g. to install new firmware code), we will use Particle’s cloud software.

-   You need to use the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser to configure your Photon 2 and visit this site:
    [https://docs.particle.io/tools/doctor/](https://docs.particle.io/tools/doctor/)

-   Go to **Login** and create a new personal account

- This process will take few minutes. As the Photon 2 updates, it will blink different colors.
- Select your Wifi network. For open networks without a password (like USC Guest Wireless), leave the password blank.

>   Workbench is the IDE we will use to write firmware code as well as to
>   install it on the device

-   Open Chrome and visit the site:
    <https://www.particle.io/workbench/>

-   Download and install Particle Workbench

Install Fritzing
----------------

>   Fritzing is a program to create visual layouts of device projects.

-   ITP has paid for a Fritzing support license for the class. To download it, please go to the course Blackboard site and click on "Fritzing Download".
