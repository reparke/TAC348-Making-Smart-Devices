Assignment 0 – Installation and Setup
=====================================

*Nothing to submit*

**Requirements**

-   Connect Photon 2 to Computer
-   Create Particle account
-   Install Particle Workbench
-   Install Fritzing
-   Add Photon 2 device to your Particle account



**IMPORTANT - Browser**

**You need to use the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser to configure your Photon 2; you <u>can not</u> use Firefox or Safari.** 

\_______________________________________\_

## Connect your Particle Photon 2 to your Computer

- Connect the antenna (discussed in class)
- Connect the Photon 2 to your breadboard (discussed in class)
- Connect the micro USB cable to your computer



Create Particle account
-----------------------

>   In this course, we will use an internet-enabled microcontroller,
>   specifically the Particle Photon 2. In order to communicate with the Photon 2 
>   (e.g. to install new firmware code), we will use Particle’s cloud software.

-   You need to use the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser to configure your Photon 2 and visit this site:
    [https://setup.particle.io](https://setup.particle.io)

-   Go to **Get Started** and create a new account for education

- Continue with the four step process to configure your device via USB. This process will take few minutes. As the Photon 2 updates, it will blink different colors.



- When you get to the following screen that says **Organize your Particle Device**, choose **or Create a New Product**

- Choose your Wifi network.  If you are on campus, use **USC Guest Wireless**, and **leave the password blank**. If it doesn't connect to Wifi on the first try, it often works if you try it again.

  - If you are off-campus and need to login to a website before you can connect to Wifi, you will need to do a couple things before you can get the Photon 2 online. You can follow these [instructions](https://reparke.github.io/ITP348-Physical-Computing/reference/general/captive_wifi.html) or reach out to course staff for assistance.
