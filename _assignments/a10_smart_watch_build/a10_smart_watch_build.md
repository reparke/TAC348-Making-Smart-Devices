## Overview

This assignment is to build a smart watch, which we will program in class. Given the semester schedule, you will build it now for us to use in a week.

## Components

-    Strip of stretchable fabric / neoprene (3" x 15")
-    Strip of plastic velcro tape (12")
-    Breadboard
-    LiPo battery
-    Photon 2

## Requirements

-   No Fritzing diagram is needed. Wiring diagram and plans are provided in the
    lecture notes.
-   [Follow the assembly instruction guide](guide_build_watch)
-   Plan to bring watch (with fully charged battery) and phone to class

**==Important: The assembly guide shows the battery being connected. Since we will be using the battery with the car, it is recommended to skip connecting the battery to the Photon 2 until we are programming the watch in class==**
