Assignment 8 – Timer with Blynk
==========================

[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu/)

Goals
-----

-   Connect speaker and play tones
-   Build Blynk app
-   Use Blynk app to set timers

## Overview

This assignment is to create a timer device which uses a Blynk app to configure the timer. The Argon will play 1 of 3 songs through a speaker.

## Components

-   Argon
-   Breadboard
-   1 x speaker
-   1 x LED
-   Jumper wire

## Requirements

-   Create a Fritzing breadboard prototype of your design. No sample is provided so it is up to you to layout the components
-   Once you are are finished, build the device
-   It is recommended to code the device in stages, and test at each stage

### Global variables

-   You can create other variables as needed, but these are required
-   `int melodyNotes[16]` and `int melodyNotesDuration[16]` to store the
    pattern of notes for the melodies your alarm will play

### Stage 1: Speaker and Tones

-   Connect the speaker, LED, and push buttons (push buttons discussed later)
-   Create two different “songs” for the alarm. Each should have distinct melodies (at least 16 notes). You can use the list of musical notes and frequencies (or do something different).
-   Test your device by playing the notes
-   The LED should flash when the alarm is going off

### Stage 2: Configure Alarm Settings via IFTTT

-   Create an IFTTT applet that allows a button press to enable / disable the
    alarm on the argon. This means if the alarm time arrives but the alarm
    status is disabled, then the alarm will NOT sound
    -   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Button widget** trigger
-   Create a IFTTT applet that allows you to cycle between the songs or the
    buzzer sound that will play on the argon when the alarm goes off
	-   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Button widget** trigger

### Stage 3: Set Alarm Time via IFTTT

-   Create an IFTTT applet to set a time and start an alarm on the argon.
    -   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Date & Time** trigger, you can create a
        **Particle** function action)
-   IFTTT only allows time triggers at :00, :15:, :30, and :45 minutes each
    hour. It is recommended (not required) to create another **Button widget**
    trigger that you can use for testing

### Stage 4: Configure operations two physical buttons (Stop and Snooze)

-   The logic of alarm is as follows: 
    -   If alarm is disabled
        -   Snooze button, stop button, and alarm time trigger have no effect
    -   If alarm is enabled
        -   If alarm time trigger goes off
            -   The selected song will play indefinitely until the stop button
                is pressed
            -   If the snooze button is pressed, the song will be paused for a
                5 minutes (for testing you can use a few seconds)

### Timing

* For playing melody notes, you can use `delay()` for a few milliseconds
* For managing the timing of events, however, use `millis()` instead of
  `delay()` 

## Extra Credit

-   IFTTT does not allow for arbitrary alarm times. Use the Particle console (or
    app) to set an arbitrary alarm time (e.g. 4:58 pm).

## Recommendation: Music Notes as Constants

* You can play all tones directly as frequencies for this assignment
* However, it can be helpful to create melodies with musical notes instead of frequencies. 
* The following code file lists the musical notes as frequencies:
  [pitches.h](pitches.h) 
* Download `pitches.h` to the `src` folder for your project.
* In your main `.ino` sketch, you can then include this file and use the constants to play musical notes.
* Example

```c++
#include "pitches.h"

// example
tone(D6, NOTE_D4, 500);	//play the D note above middle C
```
