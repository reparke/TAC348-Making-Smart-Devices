Assignment 4 – Dice
===================

*[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu)*

Goals
-----

-   Connect LEDs to Argon

-   Use push button for analog input

-   Use built-in libraries to generate random numbers

-   Use C++ arrays

**Overview**

This assignment is to create an electronic die. When a button is pressed, the
die will be “rolled” and a new value will appear. The die roll will be simulated
by generating a random number 1-6

Here is an example:

<img src="media/00b38da91ab88417934f8d94f532926e.jpg" alt="Example build" style="width:400px" />

The die value can be represented by a 3x3 grid of LED lights as follows:

<img src="media/8edb46a465062f134bc3ad675231de83.png" alt="pattern of 6 sided die" style="width:400px" />

**Components**

-   Argon

-   Breadboard

-   9 x LEDs

-   9 x resistors *(what value should you use?)*

-   1 push button

-   Jumper wire (standard header-header)

**Requirements**

-   Create a Fritzing breadboard prototype layout of your design
-   Once you’re satisfied with the design, connect the device
-   **Hint #1:** the state of each die value (which lights are on and off) can be
    represented as a 3x3 matrix (2 dimensional array / list. However, an easier
    way to think about this is as a 9-element array / list. You should create 6
    **const int** arrays that represent patterns for each die value.
-   **Hint #2:** Check out this resource on [generating random numbers](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/random-numbers/random/) in Arduino

**Required naming convention** (replace \# with the current assignment number)

-   **Project Name**

    -   itp348_a\#_lastname_firstname

-   **Zip File** (include entire project folder)

    -   itp348_a\#_lastname_firstname.zip

Deliverables
------------

*[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu)*


1.  A compressed file containing your project. Follow the guidelines for full
    credit.

    *Here are the instructions for submission*

2.  Navigate to your project folder.

3.  Include the *entire* folder in a zip file

4.  Rename the zip file based on naming convention

5.  Upload zip file to Blackboard site for our course

6.  A photograph of your device connected to USB with the blue light on.

7.  A (very) short video demonstrating your project functioning
