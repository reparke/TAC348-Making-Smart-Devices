Preliminary Ideas for Final Project
=============

[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu/)

Goals
-----

-   Brainstorm and thoughtfully consider potential ideas for final project that are appealing
-   These ideas can be refined or changed later

Overview
--------

The final project for this class is to create a prototype of a connected device. The final submission does not need to be “ready for manufacturing” but it must work and demonstrate
the key functioning elements. 

At this point in the class, we have covered only 50% of the material you will use in the project. However, you have already developed understanding of firmware and electronics.

Using the overall project requirements and list of components we will discuss in class, create two potential project ideas for your final project.

## **Project Requirements**

-   Be designed and built by the student solely. Inspiration may be taken from online and other sources, but sources must be cited and final project must be substantially different.
    
-   Use at least two sensors we discussed in class

-   Use at least two component to interact with environment (e.g. switch, button, etc.)

-   Use cloud / internet connectivity in a meaningful way

-   Must send data to a cloud system or storage

-   Must receive feedback from cloud system to produce effects in the physical world (i.e. control device remotely)
    
-   Must have an interface app to enable communication between a user and a device. It is recommended to use Losant but other systems may be used
    

    

## **Possible Project Ideas**

-   Head-mounted collision-detection and navigation wearable
-   Earthquake monitor
-   Retrofitted children’s toy
-   Home monitoring station



## Partial List of Components 

This list include the components we covered in the course. You can also use components not discussed in the course, but you are not required or expected to do so.

### Sensors

-   Temperature sensors
    -   [TMP 36](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10988)
    -   [DHT 22](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167)
-   Humidity sensor: [DHT 22](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167)
-   [Ultrasonic distance sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)
-   [Passive infrared sensor (PIR)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13285) (infrared movement detection)
-   [MAX30105 heart rate and temperature sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14045)
-   RGB sensor + gesture detection sensor

### In-class projects

* Bluetooth-controlled car
* Smart watch (heart rate + weather)

### Cloud Services

* [InitialState](https://www.initialstate.com/)
  * Storing data
  * Graphic data
  * Dashboard

* [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/)
  * Storing data
  * Graphic data
  * Dashboard

  * Creating public web interface

Deliverables (for this preliminary proposal)
------------

* Two distinct ideas


* The repo for this project contains two files: `project1.md` and `project2.md`.  Complete the questions in each to describe two different projects.
* Pick projects that you would be willing to work on.
* The projects should be distinct.  They should cover different topic/problems.
* Assume that one will be selected for you.  The numbers (`project1` and `project2`) don’t indicate priority or preference.



-   Write a proposal document with following details:

    -   Describe the problem or need you have identified, why you believe it is
        necessary to address, and how your device would address this need.

    -   Describe the target audience

    -   List the key features, sensors, interaction patterns (e.g. how will
        users interact with the device), and internet / cloud platforms

        
        

**Submission**

- Submit all documents via Blackboard

  


**Required naming convention** (replace \# with the current assignment number)

-   **Project Name**

    -   itp348_project_lastname_firstname

-   **Zip File** (include entire project folder)

    -   itp348_project_lastname_firstname.zip
