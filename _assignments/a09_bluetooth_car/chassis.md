## Warning: 

Do **not** attempt to remove chassis parts by squeezing them with pliers because they break easily. Instead gently remove them by hand.

### A Note About Directions

When we talk about the "front," "left," "right," and "back" of the  RedBot, we are referring to specific sides of the robot when viewed from above.

**replace with final picture**

 [![Directions on the RedBot](chassis.assets/Redbot_re-wired_shots-01.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_re-wired_shots-01.jpg) 



Notice that we consider the Mainboard to be on the "back" of the car.

## 2. Motors and Wheels

**NOTE:** Your motors might not be yellow. Worry not, they will work just as well!

### Locate the Following:

| **2x Front Motor Mount (C)**                                 | **2x Rear Motor Mount (D)**                                  | **2x Motor (K)**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Attach Rear Motor Mounts

Hold the wires near the middle of the Motor (K), and carefully slide a Rear Motor Mount (D) in from the side and over the two motor wires. Be  careful not to snag the wires, the cable tie, or the clear plastic  strap.

**NOTE:** The motors will **NOT ** have the donut shaped silver magnet on the end of the shaft that is shown in the pictures.



 [![Attaching rear motor mounts](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-41.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-41.jpg) 



Holding the motor wires, gently twist the Rear Motor Mount counter  clockwise so that it snaps in place on the motor and the wires are  centered in the gap of the motor mount. Again, be sure not to snag the  wires under the motor mount.



 [![Twist rear motor mount into place](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-42.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-42.jpg) 



Repeat the process for the second motor.



 [![Both rear motor mounts on the motors](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-43.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-43.jpg) 



### Attach the Front Motor Mounts

Slide a Front Motor Mount (C) onto the protruding eyelet on the front of a Motor (K). Ensure the rounded sides of the motor mounts are facing the same way.



 [![Front motor mount](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-44.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-44.jpg) 



Repeat the process for the second motor.



 [![Attach all the mounts!](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-45.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-45.jpg) 



### Attach the Motor Assemblies to the Chassis

Snap one of the motor assemblies into the left 2 horizontal slots of  the Bottom Chassis Plate (A). Make sure that the rounded edges of the  motor mounts and the wires are facing toward the center of the chassis.

Snap the other motor assembly into the right 2 horizontal slots of  the Bottom Chassis Plate (A). Again, make sure that the rounded edges of the motor mounts and the wires are facing the center of the chassis.



 [![All the motors attached](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit_Brian_Revisions-09.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit_Brian_Revisions-09.jpg) 



### Attach the Wheels

Slide one Wheel (L) onto the plastic shaft of a Motor (K). Look at  the motor shaft. Notice it has two flat edges. Make sure to line up the  flat edges of the motor shaft with the flat edges of the wheel.



 [![Slide on a wheel](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-49.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-49.jpg) 



Repeat with the other wheel.

## 5. Chassis

We can assemble the main body of the car

### Locate the Following:

| **4x Side Strut (E)**                                        | **1x Nub Caster (M)**                                        |      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| [![Side strut](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-05.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-05.jpg) | [![Nub caster](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-01.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-01.jpg) |      |

You will also need the **Top Chassis Plate** and **Bottom Chassis Plate** assemblies.

### Attach the Nub Caster

Snap the Nub Caster (M) into the slot on the back of the Bottom  Chassis Plate assembly. Make sure the Nub Caster is on the side opposite the motors (the bottom side).



 [![Adding the ball caster](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-02.jpg) 



### Add the Side Struts

Snap the four Side Struts (E) into the diagonal slots on the four corners of the Bottom Chassis Plate assembly.



 [![Adding the side struts](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-64.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-64.jpg) 



### Route the Cables

Position the Top Chassis Plate over the Bottom Chassis Plate -- but  do not snap the two plates together yet. Make sure that the front sides  of each plate line up.

Route the wires through the left and right oval slots in  the Top Chassis Plate assembly as shown.

**Note**: There are many wires shown in the photo, but our car will only have four wires (two for each motor)  

 [![Cables through cutouts](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-03.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit_Reshoot-03.jpg) 



### Attach Top Chassis Plate Assembly

Line up the Top Chassis Plate on top of all the struts, and carefully snap the Top Chassis Plate assembly onto the side struts and motor  mounts. Press gently above each side strut individually until they each  snap into place. If you have the Bumpers installed, make sure the boards are between the top and bottom plates.



 **Note**: There are many wires shown in the photo, but our car will only have four wires (two for each motor)  [![Snap top plate to side struts](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-69.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-69.jpg) 



If you need to remove the plate to change anything, gently pull  upward on each side strut individually. Do not attempt to use pliers or  hand tools, or you may end up snapping the plastic clip.

## 6. Mainboard

In this section, you will add the breadboard

### Locate the Following:

| **2x Mainboard Mount (G)**                                   | **1x Breadboard**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

You will also need the full chassis assembly, which contains any additional parts and sensors you attached in previous steps.

### Attach the Mainboard Mounts

Snap the two Mainboard Mounts (G) into the vertical slots in the back of the top chassis plate near the large rectangular opening.



 [![Add mainboard mounts](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-70.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-70.jpg) 



### Add the Mainboard

The RedBot Mainboard (P) snaps into the lowest of the notches on the  Mainboard Mounts (G). Make sure the power jack is facing the left side  of the robot. Push gently and evenly until it snaps into place.



 [![Add the mainboard](chassis.assets/Redbot_Kit-71.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/7/Redbot_Kit-71.jpg) 



**NOTE:** The other slots in the mainboard mounts can be used to hold the [Arduino UNO](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) or the [SparkFun RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757).
