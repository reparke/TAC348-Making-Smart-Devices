Assignment 8 – Alarm Clock
==========================

[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu/)

Goals
-----

-   Connect speaker and play tones

-   Connect device to Particle cloud

-   Connect to IFTTT and control device

**Overview**

This assignment is to create an alarm clock that has a speaker that can play a
song or a buzzer sound as well as a snooze button. The alarm set time and
whether it is enabled / disabled will be controlled from a mobile device via
IFTTT.

**Components**

-   Argon

-   Breadboard

-   1 x speaker

-   1 x LED

-   2 x push buttons (plus any necessary resistors)

-   Jumper wire

**Requirements**

-   Create a Fritzing breadboard prototype layout of your design. Once you’re
    satisfied with the design, connect the device

-   It is recommended to code the device in stages, and test at each stage

>   **Global variables**

-   You can create other variables as needed, but these are required

-   **int melodyNotes[16]** and **int melodyNotesDuration[16]** to store the
    pattern of notes for the melodies your alarm will play

>   **Stage 1: Speaker and Tones**

-   Connect the speaker, LED, and push button (push button discussed later)
-   Create three different “songs” for the alarm. One can be a simple alarm
    buzzer, but the other two should have distinct melodies (at least 16 notes).
    You can use the list of musical notes and frequencies (or do something
    different).
-   Test the system playing the notes
-   The LED should flash when the alarm is going off

>   **Stage 2: Configure Alarm Settings via IFTTT**

-   Create an IFTTT applet that allows a button press to enable / disable the
    alarm on the argon. This means if the alarm time arrives but the alarm
    status is disabled, then the alarm will NOT sound

    -   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Button widget** trigger

-   Create a IFTTT applet that allows you to cycle between the songs or the
    buzzer sound that will play on the argon when the alarm goes off
-   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Button widget** trigger

>   **Stage 3: Set Alarm Time via IFTTT**

-   Create an IFTTT applet to set a time and start an alarm on the argon.

    -   Hint: Using the IFTTT **Date & Time** trigger, you can create a
        **Particle** function action)

-   IFTTT only allows time triggers at :00, :15:, :30, and :45 minutes each
    hour. It is recommended (not required) to create another **Button widget**
    trigger that you can use for testing

>   **Stage 4: Configure timing and buttons (Stop and Snooze)**

-   The logic of alarm is as follows (note these are not meant to necessary be
    exact coding, just a general flow)

    -   If alarm is disabled

        -   Snooze button, stop button, and alarm time trigger have no effect

    -   If alarm is enabled

        -   If alarm time trigger goes off

            -   The selected song will play indefinitely until the stop button
                is pressed

            -   If the snooze button is pressed, the song will be paused for a
                short time (probably 10 min, but for testing you can use a few
                seconds)

-   Hint: In order to manage the timing of events, use **millis()** instead of
    **delay()**. Note that a delay of few milliseconds between individual notes
    is fine

**Extra Credit**

-   IFTTT does not allow for arbitrary alarm times. Use the Particle console (or
    app) to set an arbitrary alarm time (e.g. 4:58 pm).

**Required naming convention** (replace \# with the current assignment number)

-   **Project Name**

    -   itp348_a\#_lastname_firstname

-   **Zip File** (include entire project folder)

    -   itp348_a\#_lastname_firstname.zip

Deliverables
------------

1.  A compressed file containing your project. Follow the guidelines for full
    credit.

    *Here are the instructions for submission*

2.  Navigate to your project folder.

3.  Include the *entire* folder in a zip file

4.  Rename the zip file based on naming convention

5.  Upload zip file to Blackboard site for our course

6.  A photograph of your device connected to USB with the blue light on.

7.  A (very) short video demonstrating your project functioning

### Code Attachment: Music Notes as Constants

**Instructions**

* It can be helpful to create melodies with musical notes instead of frequencies. The following code file lists the musical notes as frequencies.

* In the `src` folder for your project, create a file called `pitches.h` and copy / paste the code below there. In your main `.ino` sketch, you can then include this file and use the constants to play musical notes.

```c++
#include "pitches.h"

// example
tone(D6, NOTE_D4, 500);	//play the D note above middle C
```

**Code**

```c++
// from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/toneMelody
