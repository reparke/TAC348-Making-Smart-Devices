**Summary**

Tech companies are recruiting / hiring teachers as brand ambassadors. Large companies like Google and Apple as well as start-ups provide perks such as conference travel, free products, gift cards, and swag in exchange for teachers promoting products on social media and at conferences. In addition, the teachers often unofficially endorse the products by using them in their classrooms.

There are potential ethical issues raised, however, both in the disclosing the benefit as well as the concept itself. The Federal Trade Commission requires disclosure if money or services are provided for an endorsement. Also, many school districts also have ethics rules and codes of conduct regarding accepting gifts. A bigger potential concern is that young children are being subtly advertised and marketed to through these sponsorships.

On the other hand, school districts are reducing funding, meaning these tech products are increasingly out of the reach of their budgets. Research also shows that teachers spend an average of $600 out-of-pocket for classroom supplies. Through these corporate sponsorship programs, students have access to services and educational tools that cash-strapped districts and teachers could not otherwise provide.

**Discussion Questions**

1. What are the implications of closer ties between technology companies and students in a classroom?
2. Imagine your younger sibling (or cousin, etc.) was in a classroom with this type of arrangement. How would you react? Would your position change if it was a college classroom instead?
3. What are the ethical issues not discussed in the article?
