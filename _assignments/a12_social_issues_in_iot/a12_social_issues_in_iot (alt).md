Social Issues in IoT / Smart Devices
============================

[Submit on Piazza](https://piazza.com) in **social_issues** folder

## Goals

- Identify an area of society being impacted by technology, particular around smart devices and the Internet of Things
- Examine the implications and nuances of the issue

**Description**

The high-tech and software industry impacts the world and lives of the public in large and small ways. As developers and technologists, we have a social, civic, and ethical responsibility to thoughtfully and respectfully engage with each other about these issues.

Students will work in pairs and sign up for a time slot throughout the semester (meaning due dates will be different for each team). Students will identify a societal impact that is caused by technology and present a discussion on Piazza. The topic and discussion should connect to mobile smart devices / the Internet of Things. This assignment will be weighted the same as a programming assignment.

**Extra credit**

- _Individual students_ (not team) can earn extra credit for thoughtful comments on each other&#39;s posts
- _Teams of students_ can earn extra credit for volunteering to lead a discussion on their topic. This will consist of a 10-minute long session where the group summarizes the article and issue, and then facilitates discussion around their proposed questions. There are a limited number of these available per semester (~3) and will be given out on a first come, first served basis.

**Requirements**

- Find an article from a reputable mainstream or tech news source
- Summarize the story and key issues in your own words
- Write at least three questions for discussion
  - Questions should not be simple yes / no questions, but should be open-ended and lead to conversations
  - For some tips to writing questions, see [https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching/student-teacher-communication/designing-effective-discussion-questions](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching/student-teacher-communication/designing-effective-discussion-questions)
