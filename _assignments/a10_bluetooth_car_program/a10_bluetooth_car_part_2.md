## Starting Code

* Starting code is provided for you which handles all the Bluetooth connections for you

* Download the starting project here: [starting project link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/reparke/ITP348-Physical-Computing/tree/main/_assignments/a10_bluetooth_car_program/ble_car_start)
* There are two files in the `src` folder
  * `argon_ble_setup.h` Handles all the Bluetooth communication. You can mostly leave this file unchanged
  * `ble_car_setup.ino` This is the project source code. Most of your changes here will be in `onDataReceived`


## Requirements

-   No Fritzing diagram is needed. Wiring diagram and plans are provided in the
    lecture notes.
-   Create the sketch to drive the car and enable communication with Bluefruit
    app. We will create the basics of driving functions and Bluetooth
    communication in class. It will be up to you to make any changes or
    optimizations
-   Add some element(s) that distinguish your car. These can be blinking lights
    or something more elaborate.

**Naming convention **

*(replace \# with the current assignment number)*

-   **Project Name**: `itp348_a#_lastname_firstname`

-   **Zip File** (project folder): `itp348_a#_lastname_firstname.zip`

## Competitions

### **Best designed car**

-   Submit a photo of your car to **==Blackboard==**
-   Students will vote anonymously for the best designed car
-   A prize will be awarded to the winner

### **Best steering and driving**

-   Upload a short video to **==YouTube==** of your car driving in a figure-8 pattern (driving and turning)
-   Students will vote anonymously for the car that drives / handles the best
-   A prize will be awarded to the winner.

## Video Submission Checklist

*To receive credit, your submitted video must clearly demonstrate the following:*

- [ ] Car driving in a figure-8 pattern (this should be upload to ==**YouTube**==)

Deliverables
