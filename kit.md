## Custom Course Kit

We have a custom kit for the course, which was packaged and provided by the great people at [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). Students will need to purchase this course kit in lieu of a textbook. In addition to items in the course kit, ITP will provide enrolled students with an [Argon](https://store.particle.io/products/argon) microcontroller and a few extra components.
