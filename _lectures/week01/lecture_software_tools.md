# Course Software Tools

## Tools

* Each of our projects will be created with a combination of software (code) and hardware (connecting physical components)
* There are two main programs we will use to created our projects

## Workbench

## Workbench

* Workbench is the IDE we use for our projects (just like PyCharm, Visual Studio, etc.)
* Workbench serves **two** purposes
  * Writing / debugging / compiling code (just like other IDEs)
  * Flashing code to device (i.e. "installing" the code you wrote onto the device)
* *Fun fact:* Workbench is built as a plugin for VS Code, a simple but powerful IDE that can be used for all kinds of other languages (e.g. python, C++, HTML)

## Fritzing

* Fritzing create visual diagrams of hardware projects
* Use this to plan out your design before actually building them
* This "prototyping" is the equivalent to writing pseudo-code before writing code

## Quick Note

There is a more formal way of describing circuits we won't use very often
