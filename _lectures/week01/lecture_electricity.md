# Electricity

## What happens?

<img src="lecture_electricity.assets/1564541287879.png" alt="width:400px" style="width:400px" />

## Why? 

## How We Approach Electricity

* Electricity can be beautifully describe with physics and mathematics
  * These approaches are rich and important
* We will focus on building an intuitive understanding and applying principles to build devices
  * There will be some basic math, but that is not our focus
* Rules of Thumbs

## Which is Stronger?

## Common Analogy

* Electricity can be thought of as water flowing down a pipe

* The higher the water falls from, the greater the pressure

* More water can flow (and flow faster) through a larger and smoother pipe

* If the water is stored in a container / vat, it will pour out until it is empty

## Common Analogy

* The "pressure" (or height) of the water is the ***voltage***
  * Measured in units called **volts (V)** 
  * Higher voltage means more potential energy
  * Our circuits will typically consider voltages 0v - 5v

## Common Analogy

* The "rate of flow" of the electricity is the ***current***
  * Measured in units called amperes or amps (A)
  * Higher amperage means electrons are flowing faster
  * In equations, current with be denoted with the letter **I**
* Note: 1 A is a lot! Our projects will consider smaller values such as 0.2 A.
  * Instead, we will say 0.2 A is 200 **milli**amps (mA)

## Compare

Two equal water jugs connected to each of these. Which has greater flow?

## Resisting the Flow

* The narrower pipes restrict or **resist** the flow of water
* The measure of how well something resist or allows electricity is **resistance**
  * Measured in units called **Ohms (Ω)**
  * More Ohms means more resistance, which means less current (flow)

## Key Concepts

* Electrons are negatively-charged particles
* Electricity is the flow of **electrons** from **positive** to **negative **(flow of energy)
* Electronics is the study of devices that control / interact with the flow of electricity

## Circuits

* Electricity will only flow if there is a **circuit** 

* A circuit is a complete loop from a positive voltage source to a negative (lesser) source, through a conductive material

## Voltage as Difference

* When we describe voltage, we are measuring the **difference** between two points
* In the water analogy, water could fall from 500 ft to 400 ft, or from 100 ft to 0 ft
  - In both cases, water fell a difference of 100 ft, but the *reference point* changed
* In a circuit, we commonly call the reference point **Ground (GND)** and say it is **0V**

* In homes and buildings, **ground** is literally connected to the earth

## Voltage Source

* In our circuits, we will use a voltage source to provide energy potential
  - USB power: 5v
  - 9V battery: 9v
  - Rechargeable lithium battery: 3.3v
* Our circuits will have a positive voltage (e.g. 3.3v or 5v) and ground voltage (0v)
* We will consider that current flows from the positive part of the circuit to the negative

## Resistors

* Resistors conduct electricity, but are used to restrict / slow the flow of current
* They can be connected either direction
* We measure values from 0Ω to 10,000Ω
  - 10,000 Ohms is 10 **kilo**Ohms (10 KΩ)

## Ohm's Law

* There are only a couple electrical laws that we need to know
* There is a relationship between **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)**

```mathematica
V = I * R
R = V / I
I = R / V
```

* If you know two, you can solve for the other one

## Example

<img src="lecture_electricity.assets/1565141579356.png" alt="height:400px" style="width:400px" />

1.) The voltage source is 9v. If we have a resistor that is 300 Ohms, what is the current?
2) The voltage source is 9v and you want to provide a current of 9mA. What size resistor should we use?

<!-- 1. 30 mA; 2. 1kOhm -->

## Breadboard

* We will use **breadboards** to connect our circuits
* The **power rails**  (on the long ends of the board) are all connected together
* On the interior, each group of 5 pins are connected

<!-- Open Fritzing to show connected pins -->
