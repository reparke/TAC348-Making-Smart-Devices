# Kit Overview



## Kit

- No course textbook
- The kit for the course is **required** and must be purchase from the bookstore
- This includes all the most of the components we will discuss during the semester
- Additional parts will be provided by instructor
- [Kit parts and pictures](https://reparke.github.io/ITP348-Physical-Computing/kit)

## Student Responsibilities

- Bring kit to class each day

- Maintain components in working order

- Instructor may provide replacements for lost components on a limited basis. Beyond that, you will have to find replacements on your own
- Instructor will distribute *one* Argon board to each student. If you stay enrolled (past week 3 drop deadline), it is yours to keep. 

## Recommendation for Organization

- Store small components in parts box

- Alternatively, create store in individual small envelopes <img src="lecture_kit_overview.assets/md-5720202.jpg" alt="small envelopes" style="width:200px" />

## Recommendation for Organization
- Keep everything protected in large case

## Particle Argon

- The **Argon** is the microcontroller we will use for our all projects
- Similar to an Arduino, this is the "brains" of our projects (just like the processor in our computers)
- Handle it carefully
