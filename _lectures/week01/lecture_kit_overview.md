# Kit Overview



## Kit

- No course textbook
  - There are two **required** kits this course
  - #1 you pick up from the TAC office in RRB (M-F @ 9-5)
  - #2 you purchased from Sparkfun (link was emailed to you). Please purchased this **as soon as possible**

- This includes all the most of the components we will discuss during the semester
- [Kit parts and pictures](https://reparke.github.io/TAC348-Making-Smart-Devices/kit)

## Student Responsibilities

- Have kit with you for class each day (if this isn't feasible, then check the course schedule for the parts needed that are needed for the current week)

- Maintain components in working order

- Instructor may provide replacements for lost components on a limited basis. Beyond that, you will have to find replacements on your own
- If you stay enrolled (past week 3 drop deadline), the TAC kit is yours to keep. 

## Recommendation for Organization

- Store small components in parts box

- Alternatively, create store in individual small envelopes <img src="lecture_kit_overview.assests/md-5720202.jpg" alt="small envelopes" style="width:200px" />

## Recommendation for Organization
- Keep everything protected in large case

## Particle Photon 2

- The **Photon 2** is the microcontroller we will use for our all projects
- Similar to an Arduino, this is the "brains" of our projects (just like the processor in our computers)
- Handle it carefully
