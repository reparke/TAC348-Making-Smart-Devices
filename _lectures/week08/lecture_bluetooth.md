# Bluetooth

 <img src="lecture_bluetooth.assets/5213ccb1757b7f4c568b4568.jpg" alt="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/4/b/e/e/9/5213ccb1757b7f4c568b4568.jpg" style="width:500px" /> 

## What is Bluetooth?

 

## Review: Communication 

- WiFi and Cellular
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  - Ex: Communication between smart watch and phone; wireless headphones
  - Range: ~1200+ ft
- Near-Field Communication (NFC) 
  - Ex: Contact-less payment like Apple Pay
  - Range: 4 inches

## Bluetooth

* Set of protocols / standards for communicating wirelessly on 2.4 GHz frequency (same as WiFi)
* Ubiquitous: uses include headphones, game controller, stylus, keyboard / mouse, speakers, mobile phones
* We will focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  * Subset of Bluetooth that is low-cost, low power
  * Also called "Bluetooth 4.0" or "Bluetooth Smart"

## Fun Fact!

* Bluetooth is named for **Harald Bluetooth**, a 10th Scandanavian king who unified parts of Denmark and Norway
* Bluetooth logo is a combination of his initials

## Device Roles

* Each device has a **General Access Profile** (GAP) which defines how it operates in relation to other devices
* **Central** devices typically have more computing power and battery life such as phones and computers
* **Peripheral** devices are lower cost and lower power such as a heart rate sensor or microcontroller like Argon

## Example: Device Roles

1. Single mobile phone triggers LEDs or motor connected to Argon
   * Phone is **central** and Argon is **peripheral**
   * Phone can connect to multiple peripherals
   * This is how we will use BLE

## Example: Device Roles

2. Broadcast messages to many phones when people enter a concert
   * Many phone are **central** and Argon is **peripheral**

<img src="lecture_bluetooth.assets/peripheral.png" alt="peripheral" style="width:750px" />

## Example: Device Roles

3. Using Argon to read signal from Bluetooth heartrate sensor
   * Argon is **central** and sensor is **peripheral** 

4. Using Argon to communicate with another Argon over Bluetooth

   * Argon is designated **central** and the other is **peripheral**
   * This is how **mesh** networking works

## Advertising

 <img src="lecture_bluetooth.assets/8228.AdvertiseScan.PNG" alt="image description" style="width:1150px" /> 

* Peripheral devices broadcast messages announcing their presence and what services they support
* Intervals are 20 ms to 10 s

## Connecting to Peripherals

* Connection between central and peripheral devices is managed through a **General Attribute Profile** (GATT)
* Devices advertise **Services** and **Characteristics**
* **Services** are collections of related objects called characteristics that describe a device functionality
* **Characteristics** are specific values for data from the device
* Each is identified by either a 16 bit or 128 bit UUID (unique ID)

## Sample Services

* Glucose monitoring
* Health thermometer
* Heart rate
* Pulse oximter
* Weight scale

## Sample Characteristics

* Last name
* Longitude
* Rainfall
* Resting heart rate
* Glucose measurement

## Specific Example

* **Service**: Health thermometer (ID: 6153 or  0x1809)
  * Used for communication of temperature value from sensor
* **Characteristics**: Temperature measurement (ID:10870 or 0x2A1C)
  * Temperature (actual temperature)
  * Temperature type (e.g. mouth, armpit, ear, etc.)
  * Interval (time between reading)


## Making the Connection

  *  Argon
     *  Use as central device to connect to sensors and other Argons
     *  Use as peripheral device to receive connections from mobile devices

## Connecting with Mobile Apps

* There are many great resources and tools online to create iOS and Androids to communicate over BLE

* This is definitely the best option for a commercial product

## Making the Connection: Custom Mobile Apps

## Connecting with Mobile Apps

* Building a mobile app is beyond the scope of this class, but we can use free testing apps to explore BLE functionality

<!--Diagnostic issue with nRF toolbox
Sometimes the argon doesn't properly disconnect from app. When app is then opened (iOS), it crashes. One fix is to exit nRF Toolbox, open Bluefruit app and connect / then disconnect from argon. Then open nRF toolbox again
