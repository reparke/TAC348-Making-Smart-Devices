## In class Lab - Stoplight and Pedestrian Signal

* We are going to build a stoplight and pedestrian signal for a intersection.
* Car traffic goes North-South.
* Pedstrian traffic goes East-West
* Green lights, red lights, and the walk signal will stay on for 5 sec (`LONG_LIGHT_DURATION`)
* Yellow lights and the don't walk signal will stay on for 2 sec (`SHORT_LIGHT_DURATION`)
* Here is how this type of intersection works

## Components
* 1 RGB LEDs
* MicroOLED
* 3 x 330 Ohm resistors



## Wiring Pin Guide

| RGB LED               | Photon 2 Pins |
| ---------------------------- | ---- |
| NorthSouth RGB LED - Red | A2 |
| NorthSouth RGB LED - Green | A5    |
| NorthSouth RGB LED - Blue | D15 (MO) |

| MicroOLED (Qwiic cable) | Photon 2 Pins |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| GND                     | GND           |
| 3V3                     | 3V3           |
| SDA (Blue)              | SDA           |
| SCL (Yellow)            | SCL           |



## Lab Stages

1. Create cycle with only traffic (North-South) stop lights

2. Add Pedestrian Walk / Don't Walk (East-West) message to OLED 

3. Make Don't Walk light blink when it is on (if time)

   

* We will work through stage 1 together


## General Approach

* We will need to create a way to represent the states using `enum`
* We will need to track state transitions with **variables** for state
* We will need to control timing with `millis()`

* What does `loop()` do
  * calculate new state
  * output traffic signal LEDs based on state
  * independently flash walk signal *(later)*
