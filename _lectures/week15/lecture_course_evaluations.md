**<span style="color:#0070c0">These are important and I really value your feedback</span>**

- Responses are **<span style="color:#990000">anonymous</span>** and I won't see until after grades are submitted
- If **<span style="color:#990000">33%</span>** of the class fills it, everyone gets **<span style="color:#990000">+1**</span> on final
- If **<span style="color:#990000">67%**</span> of the class fills it, everyone gets **<span style="color:#990000">+3**</span> on final
