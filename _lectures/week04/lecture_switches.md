# Switches

## Switches

* Similar to pushbuttons, switches open or close a circuit
* Pushbuttons are **momentary switches** because they close (complete) a circuit only while the button is pressed
* We are going to look at **maintained switches** that continue to close or open a circuit indefinitely
* We will typically just call these components "switches"

## Terminology

* **Poles**: The number of distinct circuits that can be controlled by using the switch
  * e.g. "single pole" (SP) or "double pole" (DP)
* **Throws:** The number of positions the switch allows the circuit to connect to
  * e.g. "single throw" (ST) or "double throw" (DT)

## Poles and Throws Explained

**SPST - Single Pole, Single Throw**

* There is one single circuit (**single pole**)
* The input *1P* is either connected to output *1T* or to nothing (**single throw**)
* Notice there there are two connectors on the switch (input and output)

## Poles and Throws Explained

**SPDT - Single Pole, Double Throw** (This is what you have in your kit)

* There is one single circuit (**single pole**)
* The input (1P) is either connected to output *1T* or output *2T* (**double throw**)
* Notice there there are three connectors on the switch (1 input and 2 output)

## Poles and Throws Explained

**DPDT - Double Pole, Double Throw**

* There are two circuit (**double pole**)
* Input 1P is either connected to output *1T* or output *2T* (**double throw**)
* Input 2P is either connected to output *1T* or output *2T* (**double throw**)
* Notice there there are six connectors on the switch (2 input and 4 output)

## Lab (in three stages)

1) Wire an RGB LED and have it display random colors
2) Then create functions to change colors
3) Import `rgb-controls` library to animate colors
