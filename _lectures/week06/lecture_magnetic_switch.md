# Magnetic Switch

##  Magnetic Switch

* Switch is "normally open" (open circuit)
* Switch is activated / closed (completing the circuit) when placed near a magnet
* Often used to check for open drawers, doors, etc.
* These are also called a *reed switch* 



## How Reed Switches Work

## Wiring and Operation

* Connect one wire  
  * 3.3v with 10k pullup resistor
  * Argon digital input pin
* Connect other wire to ground
* Switch is **not polarized** so use either wire
* When reading signal from Argon
  * **HIGH** means open circuit (no magnet present) 
  * **LOW** means closed circuit (magnet present)

## Wiring Example

## Quick Note

* Wire ends are thin and twisted together so be careful inserting them into breadboard
* For greater durability, wire ends can be soldered

## Lab:

## Lab Part 1:

* When the magnetic switch is opened or closed, publish cloud event with the message `door was opened` or `door was closed` when `doorState` changes. Note **only one** publish should occur every time door is opened or closed *(Hint: Think about how this operation is similar to other things we've done. what variables would you need to this?)*
* Your name should be 
  `ITP348_Door`

* Change the RGB colors based on their door status
  * Red means "door is open"
  * White means "door is closed"
